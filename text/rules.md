# FORTRAN
A game for two players, age 12 and up, which teaches computer program instructions --- learning while playing.

Developed at the Department of Physics, Bar Ilan University.

## GAME INCLUDES:
3 playing boards, each representing a particular computer program.

6 Indicator peices, 3 each of two colors.  One playing die.

3 Numerical COUNTERS labeled A, B and C.

2 PRINTERS and 2 Storage compartments for Indicators

Glossary of terms and COMMANDS.

## OBJECT OF THE GAME:
To have the maximum number of points on the player's Printer at games end.

## HOW TO PLAY:
### Setting Up
1. Choose the program on which to play.  It is suggested that Program No. 1 be used until players are familiar with terms and strategies.
2. Each player has one PRINTER and Storage compartment with 3 Indicators of the same color.  Both PRINTERS are set at 000, and the three COUNTERS A, B and C are set at the blank space between 9 and 0 indicating that their balue is as yet undetermined (not yet set to any specific value).
3. Player throw die, highest score goes first.

### Playing the Game
1. Starting player throws die, takes one of his Indicators from Storage and moves the Indicator from the word START down the column the number of steps shown on the die.  The COMMAND at the location where the Indicator lands must be executed, which finishes that turn.  Play then alternates, each player throwing the die, moving one of his three Indicators down the column the number of steps shown on the die, and executing the COMMAND at the new location of his Indicator.
2. **Important** -- At the first stage of the game, only COMMANDS that assign values to COUNTERS are valid.  For example, and Indicator landing on the first move at `A = B + 4` cannot execute this COMMAND because COUNTER B undetermined and does not yet have a value.  A COMMAND like `B = 1` is valid since it assigns a value to a COUNTER.
3. COMMANDS must be executed exactly as stated.  Therefore, the COMMAND `A = 1` is executed by setting COUNTER A to show a value of 1 (001) regardless of its previous value, and regardless of which player lands on this COMMAND.  Each time an Indicator lands on a COMMAND which changes the value of a COUNTER, that COUNTER is reset to show its new value.
4. **REMEMBER,** -- a player can move only one Indicator each turn and must execute the COMMAND on which the Indicator lands.  If the COMMAND cannot be executed the Indicator is returned to the location from which it started and a different indicator is moved.  If no indicator may be moved, play passes to the other player.
5. PRINT == A player landing on a COMMAND to PRINT, adds the sum of the values of the COUNTERS that follow the word PRINT to the value already shown on his PRINTER, without changing the values of the COUNTERS.
