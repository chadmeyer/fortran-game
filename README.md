# fortran-game
An implementation of the 1973 board game FORTRAN.

## Goal of this project
Create a working version of this game (in Fortran of course but likely also in something like python).

## Background
This game was made in 1973 (50 years ago; when FORTRAN was a *mere* 16 years old) as an educational game for 12 year olds.

## Sources
The game itself is hard to find, however the internet contains enough information to reconstruct the rules and two of the three game boards.
